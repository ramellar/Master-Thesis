\section{Introduction} \label{intro}

The unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces leading to the Electroweak force was experimetally verified by the discovery of the Z boson in 1983 at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. Nevertheless, although in this theory the gauge bosons $W^\pm$ and Z are considered to be massless, the experimental results proved the opposite. To explain the mass of these particles, we need to introduce the Higgs field, as via the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism these gauge bosons can acquire mass.

Explain better the Higgs flied and the potential and so on. The Higgs boson is excitation of this field. It's discovery proves the existence of a fundamental scalar sector in the SM.

%Nowadays the Higgs boson mass measured by the CMS experiment is 125.53 GeV with a precision of 0.15 GeV (cite). To further characterize this particle, there is an ongoing experimental effort to determine the value of the self-coupling $\lambda$, which will also allow to probe the shape of the scalar potential of the Higgs mechanism.
