\subsubsection{pt reg} \label{subsubsec: btag-ptreg}
The \pt regressed is the one computed using a DNN. The main idea is that, we train a DNN with information from the reco jets and we try to retrieve the original energy if these jets. For efficiency purposes this DNNN gives out the ratio of the predicted E/ original E. To improve the analysis, we use \pt reg, which means that we multiply the \pt measured by the detector times this ratio, which allows us ti have a more precise value of thee \pt of the objects we are using.
