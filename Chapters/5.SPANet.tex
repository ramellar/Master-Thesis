% Defintipnos of embedding layers

In order to improve the pairing done using the Run 2 method we want to use the attention-based neural network SPANet, whose architecture will be presented in section \ref{section: spanet architecture}. As we previously mentioned, we are interested in the decay of two Higgs Boson particles into 2 b quarks respectively. Therefore, in the final state we want at least 4 jets that we want to match to the original b quarks coming from the Higgs' decay.
