abstract = {We present predictions for the SM-Higgs-pair production channels of relevance at the LHC: gluon–gluon fusion, VBF, and top-pair, W, Z and single-top associated production. All these results are at the NLO accuracy in QCD, and matched to parton showers by means of the MC@NLO method; hence, they are fully differential. With the exception of the gluon–gluon fusion process, for which a special treatment is needed in order to improve upon the infinite-top-mass limit, our predictions are obtained in a fully automatic way within the publicly available MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework. We show that for all channels in general, and for gluon–gluon fusion and top-pair associated production in particular, NLO corrections reduce the theoretical uncertainties, and are needed in order to arrive at reliable predictions for total rates as well as for distributions.}

The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.}

abstract = {Particle physics is a branch of science aiming at discovering the fundamental laws of matter and forces. Graph neural networks are trainable functions which operate on graphs—sets of elements and their pairwise relations—and are a central method within the broader field of geometric deep learning. They are very expressive and have demonstrated superior performance to other classical deep learning approaches in a variety of domains. The data in particle physics are often represented by sets and graphs and as such, graph neural networks offer key advantages. Here we review various applications of graph neural networks in particle physics, including different graph constructions, model architectures and learning objectives, as well as key open problems in particle physics for which graph neural networks are promising.}

ABSTRACT = {The discovery of the Higgs boson confirms the existence of a scalar sector of the standard model, responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking, but the nature and properties of the potential at the origin of this mechanism are still unknown. By studying the production of pairs of Higgs bosons (HH), physicists can directly measure the coupling of the Higgs boson to itself and thus determine the shape of this potential, which has far-reaching implications on the origin and evolution of our Universe. Because of this deep connection to the foundations of electroweak symmetry breaking, HH production is also an ideal place to search for manifestations of yet-unknown physics, such as modifications of the strength of the self-coupling and of the interaction between pairs of vector bosons and Higgs bosons. In this review article, we summarize the current searches for HH production at ATLAS and CMS, using the LHC Run 2 dataset, discuss the implications of our current constraints on physics beyond the standard model, and briefly review prospect for future HH searches.},

abstract = {We update instability and metastability bounds of the Standard Model electroweak vacuum in view of the recent ATLAS and CMS Higgs results. For a Higgs mass in the range 124–126 GeV, and for the current central values of the top mass and strong coupling constant, the Higgs potential develops an instability around 1011 GeV, with a lifetime much longer than the age of the Universe. However, taking into account theoretical and experimental errors, stability up to the Planck scale cannot be excluded. Stability at finite temperature implies an upper bound on the reheat temperature after inflation, which depends critically on the precise values of the Higgs and top masses. A Higgs mass in the range 124–126 GeV is compatible with very high values of the reheating temperature, without conflict with mechanisms of baryogenesis such as leptogenesis. We derive an upper bound on the mass of heavy right-handed neutrinos by requiring that their Yukawa couplings do not destabilize the Higgs potential.}

The EvtGen package provides a framework for the implementation of physics processes relevant to decays of B mesons and other resonances. Models of time dependent CP asymmetries in neutral B meson decays, semileptonic form-factor models, and a full decay table for B decays are a few of the implemented features.}

The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.}
