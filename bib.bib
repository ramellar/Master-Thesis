abstract = {Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions at s=7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb−1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb−1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signaling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.}

abstract = {We report the observation of four electron-positron pairs and one muon pair which have the signature of a two-body decay of a particle of mass ∼ 95 GeV/c2. These events fit well the hypothesis that they are produced by the process p̄ + p → Z0 + X (with Z0 → ℓ+ + ℓ−), where Z0 is the Intermediate Vector Boson postulated by the electroweak theories as the mediator of weak neutral currents.}
